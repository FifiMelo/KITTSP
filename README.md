# KITTSP is a generaliztion of TSP (Traveling Sailsman Problem)
The goal of this project is to find K independent tours, that each visits all the nodes of the graph.
Each two tours are independent, which means that they don't share a single edge.

# KITTSP is a binary-linear programming problem
To solve this problem we use a framework called cplex, from IBM.
